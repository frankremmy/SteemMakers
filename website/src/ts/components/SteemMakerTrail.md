We reward makers and DIYers by upvoting their quality content, and also publish them on our website for more visibility. We also do this to encourage them for their effort. You can support us today by following our trail.

#### What is Curation Trail?
In the steem blockchain, not everybody has the same amount of time or level of engagement to put their available Steem Power to good use. That doesn't necessarily mean they don't believe in the platform or don't want it to succeed. Services exist that offer the possibility to automatically vote similarly to the trail you follow. There are available options to set the voting percentage, but basically it means you can automatically vote for the same blog posts the SteemMakers community account votes for. Investors in the blockchain who care about quality contents also do so. This is a win-win situation, the content creator gets more upvotes and visibility while the investor at the same time receives curation rewards. The most popular and trusted service to follow our trail is steemauto.
